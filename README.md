# Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook files 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook templates for data science that has content on Regression Models. 
These python files are designed to help you run and understand simple codes on the various regression models such as Simple Linear, Multiple and Logistic Regression Models.

## Notebook Files
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

- **Simple Linear Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for building simple linear regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Multiple Regression Analysis Template:** This template provides a starting point for building multiple regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Binomial Logistic Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for the creation of a binomial logistic regression model in Python. It includes code for importing data, doing exploratory data analysis, constructing the regression model and evaluating the model performance.
